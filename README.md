**Mock project: Open Cart Functional testing

**Description**

This is a mock project for conducting functional testing of the OpenCart website. OpenCart is a popular open-source e-commerce platform that allows users to create and manage online stores. This project aims to validate the functional characteristics of OpenCart and ensure that it meets the requirements and expectations of its users.

I've created document: Functional Requirements OpenCart based on the documentation available on their website: https://www.opencart.com/, and was inspired by Pavan from youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@sdetpavan

**Disclaimer**
This mock project is not affiliated with OpenCart or its development team. It is solely created for educational and testing purposes.
